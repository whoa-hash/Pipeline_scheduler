  <em>A Flexible Service Locator for Python.</em>

<!-- begin index -->

*svcs* (pronounced *services*) is a **dependency container** for Python.
It gives you a central place to register factories for types/interfaces and then imperatively acquire instances of those types with **automatic cleanup** and **health checks**.

It's suitable for implementing [Inversion of Control](https://svcs.hynek.me/en/latest/glossary.html#term-Inversion-of-Control) using either **dependency injection** or **service location** while not requiring global state, decorators, or mangling of function signatures.

<!-- begin benefits -->
Benefits:

- Eliminates tons of repetitive **boilerplate** code,
- unifies **acquisition** and **cleanups** of services,
- provides full *static* **type safety** for them,
- simplifies **testing** through **loose coupling**,
- improves *live* **introspection** and **monitoring** with **health checks**.

The goal is to minimize the code for acquiring pluggable services to:

<!-- end index -->
<!-- end benefits -->

<!-- skip: next -->

```python
from svcs.your_framework import svcs_from

def view(request):
    db, api, cache = svcs_from(request).get(Database, WebAPIClient, Cache)
```

... or less!

<!-- begin addendum -->
To a type checker like [Mypy](https://mypy-lang.org), `db` has the type `Database`, `api` has the type `WebAPIClient`, and `cache` has the type `Cache`.
`db`, `api`, and `cache` will be automatically cleaned up when the request ends -- it's context managers all the way down.
<!-- end addendum -->

*svcs* comes with seamless integration for **AIOHTTP**, **FastAPI**, **Flask**, **Pyramid**, and **Starlette**.

<!-- begin typing -->
While *svcs* also has first-class support for static typing, it is **strictly optional** and will always remain so.
*svcs* also doesn't check your types at runtime.
It only forwards the type you have asked for to the type checker.
If you don't use a type checker, that information is ignored without any runtime overhead.
<!-- end typing -->

## Release Information

### Added

- Python 3.13 support.

- `svcs.Registry` now implements a `__iter__` method that allows to iterate over its registered services.
  [#106](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/106)


### Removed

- Python 3.8 support.


### Changed

- Flask: The registry is now stored on `app.extensions`, not `app.config`.
  This is an implementation detail.
  If you are directly accessing the registry via `app.config`, this is a breaking change, though you should ideally move to `svcs.flask.registry` anyway.
  [#71](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/discussions/71)
  [#72](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/issues/72)
  [#73](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/73)

- `Registry.register_factory()` is now more lenient regarding the arguments of the factory.
  It only looks at the first argument (if present) and ignores the rest.
  [#110](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/110)


### Fixed

- `Container.aget()` now also enters and exits synchronous context managers.
  [#93](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/93)

- `Container.aget()` now also enters and exits context managers that are returned by async factories.
  [#105](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/105)
