This is a workthrough of using Airflow, a task scheduler. It uses Python and can be seen on the Airflow UI (usually localhost:8080).
I used Ubuntu for WS for Linux as well as VSCode for Github access. 
I used a virtual environment so I had to manually download a couple packages in order for this to work, like psycopg2, gcc etc as well as edit the config file with [Default] as a file header.
