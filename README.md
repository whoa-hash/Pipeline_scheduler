This is a workthrough of using Airflow, a task scheduler. 

It uses Python and can be seen on the Airflow UI (usually localhost:8080 if you are just starting out).

I used Ubuntu for WS for Linux as well as VSCode for Github access. 
I used a virtual environment so I manually downloaded a couple packages in order for Airflow to be downloaded successfully, like psycopg2, gcc etc as well as edits to the config file with [Default] as a file header.
